## Project 10 - React Full Stack Project

In this project, I have created a front end application using React. With the api I created in unit 9, I am able to use the 4 common http methods: get, post, put, and delete, along with using an authorization header.

## Deployment

To deploy this project, make sure that you change into the api directory to start up the back end server

```bash
  cd api
  npm start
```

Next, you want to cd into the client folder to start up the react client side server

```bash
  cd client
  npm start
```

You can create your own user by using the sign up link or you can use:
user: joe@smith.com
password: joepassword
